## Setup Instructions (if didn't work)

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows), navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

This command creates a new folder named `myenv` that contains your virtual environment.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Run Your Program

Run your Python script while the virtual environment is active:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When youâ€™re finished, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```
